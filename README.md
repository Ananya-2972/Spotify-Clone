# Spotify-Clone
This project involved crafting a visually appealing interface with a focus on layout and style, closely mimicking the familiar features of Spotify using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. I've built a responsive and intuitive music app that showcases album art, playlists, and track details in a modern, engaging way.
